# odin-battleship

## This is a browser version of battleship that pits the computer against itself and can be viewed through the console

This is a project written in vanilla javascript using webpack and jest that was completed as part of The Odin Project Javascript Curriculum. This project was my first major foray into Test Driven Development principles. In order to save some time I did not build out a user interface and instead just used TDD to create the logic and then finished the project by having the computer compete against itself with random moves.
